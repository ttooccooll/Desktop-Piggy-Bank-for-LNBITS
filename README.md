This is a UI for an LNBITS wallet that's meant to look like a piggy bank. Children can track their deposits but don't have the ability to withdrawal. It is meant to function like a physical piggy bank and the parents can always go back to the original LNBITS url and withdrawal when a large enough amount of money has been accumulated to place somewhere more secure. There are a few other fun learning links and various real-time stats for the network.

Open the .env file in the main folder here. Get your admin key from LNBITS and use it for the value of REACT_APP_X_API_KEY=
Remember that anyone with this key can take all the money from this wallet!!!
If you've made an LNURL key in LNBITS, you can put it there as well. I'll let you guess what goes in the name category. Then open up a terminal, go to this folder, and type in "npm start". Hit enter and you should be up and running!

Big thanks to plebdevs.com and their plebdev course, where I learned how to make lightning wallets!

(Do NOT send sats here unless you intend to give them to me!)
